## RU56: Rust Physics Simulator (That Nobody Asked For)

Welcome to RU56, the physics simulator written in Rust that you will almost certainly never use. I made this because I thought it would be cool, but let's be honest there are already a million better physics engines out there, and this one probably won't even compile on your machine.

### Features (if you can call them that)
- Written in Rust, because why not make things harder?
- Simulates physics, allegedly.
- Documentation? You're looking at it.

### Installation
Don't.

### Contributing
Please don't. Save yourself.

### License
MIT, because I don't care what you do with this. Just don't blame me when it doesn't work.
